# Simple pomodoro clock

This is a very simple HTML, CSS and JS web "Pomodoro" clock. 

* Open index.html in a browser to "run" the project.
* The `Start` button starts the clock. The label will tell you that is `time to study`. When 25 minutes have passed the label will change to `rest`. Once another 5 minutes of rest have passed the label will go back to `time to study`.
* Once you have started the clock the button will change to `Stop`. If you click it, the clock will reset itself back to 00:00:00, stop, and the button will change to the initial state of `Start`.
